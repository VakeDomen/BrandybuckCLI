# Brandybuck
Brandybuck is a command line tool, that allows developers to generate fully working 
web REST API web servers. Brandybuck generates a functioning NodeJS application running
Express using Typescript. The user may define a JSON configuration file, upon which the application is generated.
The features include:
  - Model specification
  - Database support
  - Authentication
  - Docker support
  - Traefik v2 reverse proxy support
  
The generated web server may serve as a complete backend appliction for smaller projects, or can be expanded and provide 
a fast start on the way to the desired project.

# Installing 
The tool may be installed from the snap store by running the command
```
snap install brandybuck --edge --devmode
```

# Usage
The tool is used by running the `brandybuck` command.  
It can work in one of two ways. Either you can run it with `init` or `build` command.
  
# Init
Before building the web server, Brandybuck has to know what kind od server you want. Running the command 
```
brandybuck init
```
will create two files within the directory from which it was run. The files will be called `brandybuck.config.json` 
and `brandybuck.models.json`. The files are used by the developer to specify the configurations of the web server
that should be generated.  

## Metadata configuration
By default the `brandybuck.config.json` configuration file will look something like this:
```
{
  "project_name": "Unknown",
  "port": 3000,
  "auth": true,
  "model_source": "./brandybuck.models.json",
  "database": "SQLITE",
  "docker": {
    "port": 3000,
    "traefik2": false
  }
}
```
All the attributes have default values, within the tool, so you don't have to specify all the features within the .json, but only the modifications
of the default configuration. Overview of the attributes can be seen in the tables below.

Attribute | Type | Default | Description
--- |--- |--- |--- 
project_name | string | "Unknown" | Specifies the name of the generated project. Will resonate in folder structure, package.json and container names.
port | number | 3000 | Specifies the port the server should listen to.
auth | boolean | false | Specifies whether authentication should be generated.
model_source | string | "./brandybuck.models.json" | Specifies the the location of the configration file that describes the models.
database | string | "SQLITE" | Specifies the database that the server should use. (Currently only supports SQLITE)
docker | boolean/configuration object | { "port": 3000, "traefik2": false } | Specifies whether and/or how dockerization files should be generated .
log | boolean | true | Adds some aditional logging to the generated server.
documentation | boolean | true | TODO: not yet implemented ;)

### Docker configuration

The docker configuration can either be specified by a `boolean` or an `object`. The overview of the object configruation 
attributes can be seen in the table below.

Attribute | Type | Default | Description
--- |--- |--- |--- 
port | number | 3000 | Specifies the port the docker should expose. Automatically binds to the exposed port to the server port.
traefik2 | string / configuration object | false | Specifies whether and/or how traefik v2 configuration should be generated.

### Trefik configuration
If the dockerization was enabled, there is an option to configure the container to run with [Traefik v2](https://docs.traefik.io/v2.0/) 
by specifying the `traefik2` attribute in docker. The overview of the configurations for traefik can be seen in the table below:

Attribute | Type | Default | Description
--- |--- |--- |--- 
container_name | string | "brandybuck_traefik_container_<random string>" | Specifies the name of the container. Will resonate in the name of the router and service of traefik container.
proxy_network_name | string | "proxy" | Specifies the name of the external network, so the container is visible to traefik.
certresolver_name | string | "le" | Name of your traefik certresolver.
entrypoint_name | string | "websecure" | Name of your traefik entrypoint.
domain | string | "ww<span>w.p</span>rojectname.com" | Domain name of your project.

## Models
Once the metadata of the project have been specified there is one more configuration to be cofigured. We must specify the resources that the
server should store and serve. These models will define how your database is structured and how the server routes are generated. The data for 
this is strored in the `brandybuck.models.json` configuration file.  
The model file will come pre-generated with one dummy model, so it is easier to get started. This model is to be modified/deleted in your final
configuration. 
```
{
  "models": [
    {
      "name": "table",
      "crud": {
        "create": true,
        "create_auth": false,
        "read": true,
        "read_auth": false,
        "update": true,
        "update_auth": false,
        "delete": true,
        "delete_auth": false
      },
      "fields": [
        {
          "name": "col1",
          "data_type": "VARCHAR",
          "null": false
        },
        {
          "name": "col2",
          "data_type": "VARCHAR",
          "null": false
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

The model configuration files contains a json which is nothing more than just an array of model objects. The model object is constructed from 
three main attributes: `name`, `crud` and `fields`.  Important note is that the server application handles generation od `id` fields by itself 
so you should not specify the field named `id`. The server uses `uuid` to generate all ids.

### Name
Name attribute specifies the name of the resource. It is recommended to name your models in a singular form, in consideration to readability of the 
generated source code since the generator appends the `s` to the end of the model names for database table names and such (i.e. `post -> posts`).

### CRUD
The `crud` field describes which endpoints should be generated for the specified resource (`read`, `create`, `update`, `delete`). Each of the attributes 
defaults to `true`.  
In the case you specified `auth` to `true` in the `brandybuck.config.json` you can specify if the route corresponding to the CRUD function needs to verify
the user authentication. You can do that by specifying `read_auth`, `create_auth`, `update_auth` or `delete_auth` (they all default to `false` and are 
irrelevant if the `auth` value is `false`).

### Fields
The `fields` attribute is an array of field object and describes the structure of the model. Each field is described by three main attributes seen in 
the table below:

Attribute | Type | Default | Description
--- |--- |--- |--- 
name | string | "col" | Specifies the name of the model attribute / column.
data_type | string | "VARCHAR" | Specifies the data type of the column. Corresponds directly to the avalible types of the `database` that was specified in the `brandybuck.config.json`.
null | boolean | false | Specifies if the column may contain null values.

Each model may have any number of fields.

# Build
Once the configuration has been specified it is time to build the project. You can do that by running the command below in a directory, that
contains the `brandybuck.config.json` and `brandybuck.models.json` configuration files.
```
brandybuck build
```

## Folder structure
The tool will read the configuration files and create the project. The full build folder structure looks something like this (may 
differ based on configuration): 
```
root/
  |-- Unknown/
  |   |-- app/
  |   |   |-- db/
  |   |   |
  |   |   |-- migrations/
  |   |   |   |--  001-inital-schema.sql   
  |   |   |
  |   |   |-- src/
  |   |   |   |-- auth/
  |   |   |   |-- db/
  |   |   |   |-- models/
  |   |   |   |   |-- core/
  |   |   |   |
  |   |   |   |-- routes/
  |   |   |   |-- server.ts
  |   |   |
  |   |   |-- package.json
  |   |   |-- tsconfig.json
  |   |
  |   |-- dockerfile
  |   |-- docker-compose.yml
  |   |-- server.entrypoint.sh
  |
  |-- brandybuck.configuration.json
  |-- brandybuck.models.json
```

## Authentication
If the `auth` attribute was set to `true`, brandybuck will auto generate the `user` model so it is structured in a way that is compatible with 
the generated source code. You may modify the user later but it is recommended, that upon specifying the auth flag you should not generate own user
models.  
Structure of the user model looks like this: 
```
{
  id: string,
  name: string,
  password: string,
  role: 'USER' | 'ADMIN'
}
```
Passwords are hashed and salted and you get the control of setting the `hash salt rounds` in the generated `.env` file (default is 10). Authentication 
uses `JWT tokens` to authenticate the user.  
In the generated `.env` file, there is also a field `ADMIN_EMAIL` where you may specify an email. If a user registers with that email the user will get
an `ADMIN` value and others will get the `USER` value. 
  
The user model does not have any CRUD methods and can not be retrieved from the server via an HTTP route. If a user wants to be registered to the server
this can be accomplished by sending a `POST` request to to `<domain>/auth/local/register` with the body:
```
{
  "name": "User Name",
  "email": "user@email.com",
  "password": "usersecretpassword"
}
```
From this point the registered user can now login to the application by sending a `POST` request to to `<domain>/auth/local/login` with the body:
```
{
  "email": "user@email.com",
  "password": "usersecretpassword"
}
```
In the response the user will recieve a `Bearer token` that should be send in the header of all requests that require authentication:
```
"Authorization": "Bearer <token>" 
```


# Running the generated server
You can run the generated application directly by moving into the `app` folder and first installing the application dependencies with:
```
cd <name>/app
npm install
```
You can then start the application by running:
```
npm run start
```
or production version by running;
```
npm run prod
```
If you jut want to transpile the application you can run:
```
npm run tsc
```

## Docker
If you specified the dockerization of the project, you can run the docker container with commands:
```
cd <name>/
docker-compose up
```

# Modifying environment
Branybuck will generate `.env` and `.env.sample` files for both the app and the potential docker configuration. The configurations will be
pre-filled but you can change them at any time. For the application itself the `.env.sample` looks like this:
```
PORT=
JWT_SECTRET=
ADMIN_EMAIL=
HASH_SALT_ROUNDS=
SQLITE_DB=
```
The full docker configuration with the traefik support enabled will have an option to modify the domain of the application shown below.
```
PORT=
JWT_SECTRET=
ADMIN_EMAIL=
HASH_SALT_ROUNDS=
SQLITE_DB=
DOMAIN=
```
